        <h1>About</h1><br>
        <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.<br> I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the<br> morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind<br> coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I<br> cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. <br>I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace,<br> I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign.<br> I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature,<br> I like people. And, I like to laugh.
         </p>
         <br>
         <br>
         <p>
            I always wanted to be a great writer, like Victor Hugo who wrote "Les Miserable", or like Roman Roland who wrote<br> "John Christopher". They have influenced millions of people through their books. I also wanted to be a great <br>psychologist, like William James or Sigmund Freud, who could read people’s mind. Of course, I am nowhere close <br>to these people, yet. I am just someone who does some teaching, some research, and some writing. But my dream is <br>still alive.

        <h1>Career Goals</h1>
        <p class="skills-info">
            I'm looking to set some long term goals now. I realised I'm being sidetracked by all the different technologies coming out and I really want to settle down and focus on one thing. I believe setting a definite goal will help me achieve that. I know goals are personal and unique, but I'm sure I can get some inspiration from someone.
            <br>
            <br>
            I would wish to work with an international conmpany that gives me room for expantion and growth.
            <br>
            <br>
            In a few months My team and I will be launching a new product in the market, we hope that you will enjoy it.
